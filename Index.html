							Will you be the Helmsman, deftly guiding your ship through all the dangers of the sector? 
							Or the Weapons officer, locking on to your enemy before you send them to a fiery death? 
							Or perhaps the Science officer, scanning the enemy for weaknesses and providing navigational bearings? 
							Or maybe the Communications officer, coordinating the efforts of your allies and convincing your foes that 
							they should surrender while they still can? 
							Or do you want to be the maestro of the Engineering console, keeping all the systems running at their peak 
							efficiency while coordinating the damage control teams to heal your ship? 
							Or do you want to be the Captain, taking the input from all your officers in order to make the hard decisions 
							that have to be made in order to survive and emerge victorious?
						</p>
						<p>
							The Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator lets you play any of these roles as you go up against fleets from multiple 
							races who want to destroy your ship and your space stations in order to wrest control of the sector away from you. 
							This is one of the most enjoyable team-building experiences that you will ever have!
